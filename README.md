# 📦 Northwind Data Warehouse

A complete end-to-end **Data Warehouse project** designed using the Northwind OLTP database. This project showcases dimensional modeling, star schema design, and ETL development using **SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)** — ideal for powering business intelligence and analytical reporting.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to transform a transactional (OLTP) system into an analytical (OLAP) system by:

- Designing a **Star Schema** from the normalized Northwind database
- Implementing ETL processes in **SSIS**
- Handling data cleaning, nulls, type casting, and business logic
- Populating the **Fact** and **Dimension** tables for analytical querying

## ⚙️ ETL Process with SSIS

- Developed ETL data pipelines using SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) to automate the extraction, transformation, and loading of data from the source database (OLTP) to the data warehouse (OLAP).
- The important part was loading the data into the Fact Table and that was done by collecting all the IDs from tables in the source database using a Merge Join transformation.
- Data cleansing using **Derived Columns** and **ISNULL** logic
- Lookups on dimensions to replace business keys with surrogate keys

## 📌 How to Run the Project

1. **Restore the Northwind DB**  
   Use `NorthWind_DB.bak` or run `Northwind_DB_Creation.sql` in SSMS

2. **Create the Data Warehouse schema**  
   Run `NorthWind_DWH_creation.sql` to build the DWH tables

3. **Execute the SSIS Package**  
   Open the SSIS package in Visual Studio and run to populate the DWH
